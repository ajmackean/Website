<p>jazz was my first love. my dad was a trumpet player and i grew up listening to Louie Armstrong and Count Bassie. he taught me how to appreciate different music genres and to grow as a musician.</p>

<p>during broadcasting school i scored some student films and provided sound design for my peers. i found that the atmosphere and mood of a scene was more dependant on the audio than the visual components themselves.</p>

<p>i complement my love for jazz and synthesis with a focus on melody and mood. my music is written thematically first and then coloured outwards.</p>
